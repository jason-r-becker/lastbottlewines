  I prefer structured, medium+ to full-bodied red wines with firm but
  polished tannins and a smooth, rounded mid-palate. Favor Cabernet-dominant
  blends or high-quality Merlot, as well as Chianti Classico Riserva or Gran
  Selezione. Look for dark fruit (blackberry, cassis, dark cherry), integrated
  oak (vanilla, cocoa, espresso), and strong but refined structure. Avoid thin
  high-acid wines or overly jammy sweet styles.
